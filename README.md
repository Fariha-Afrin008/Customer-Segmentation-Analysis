- Understand customer behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Segment customers into four categories: top customers, loyal customers, immediate attention, at-risk/need attention
- Find total revenue generated by each customer segment
- Visualize revenue percentage and segment distributions using interactive Excel dashboards

---

## 📊 Tools & Techniques Used
